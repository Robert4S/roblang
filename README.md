# Roblang compiler and language

I am an IB computer sciences student, and this compiler is a pet project of mine. It is being developed as learning exercise, and not as a useful tool, as I do not have the time nor expertise to create a language or compiler that provides any genuine advantage over any already established languages. Feel free to raise any issues or suggestions if you do decide to try it out.

Note:
The compiler is not currently functional, as I am still developing the parser for it, but feel free to have a look at the current source code.

(I'm not following a compiler book, and I'm lazy. That is why the code is shitty.)

##Installation dependencies
GCC (support for other C compilers coming soon)
rustup

##Installation
Provided you have rustup installed:
run "cargo install roblang" in your terminal.
